Brand new Vue user but I've started implementing it here for the purpose of building out my final project!

## Part 1: JSON
There are two JSON files (the same, in two different locations).
I access `data.json` in the config file to dynamically render my school data table on the About page.  

## Part 2: JSON and Fetch
The `data1.json` that lives in the public folder is `fetched` in the methods at the bottom of the About page only once a User clicks on the `Get School Data` button.  

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

npm run lint
```
